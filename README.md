# The Sentiment Compass: AI-Powered Suicide Prevention System
## (Dalhousie Shiftkey Cognizant BrAInstorm Challenge 11.7 - 11.9)

1. What is the Project?
Our project is called the "Sentiment Compass." It is an AI system. Its main goal is to predict if someone is at high risk for suicide. We want to give this information to hospitals and government health teams. This way, they can offer help right away.

2. Which Theme Does It Fit?
This project fits into Theme #2: Assist individuals, communities or companies track their impact.We track a negative impact: the risk of suicide in a community. When we track this risk, we can see if our efforts to help are working. It makes an invisible problem visible and measurable.

3. Why Is This Important?
It is very hard for doctors and therapists to know who is in immediate danger. They usually rely on old data or only what people tell them. We need a way to spot danger before a crisis happens. Our AI gives them an early warning system.

4. How Does the AI Work?
Our system uses text data. Reading the Words (NLP): We use a type of AI called Natural Language Processing (NLP). The AI "reads" the text. It looks for signs of sadness, hopelessness, or specific danger phrases.Checking the Context: The AI does not just look at single words. It understands the context. This helps it tell the difference between feeling a little sad and being in a serious crisis.
